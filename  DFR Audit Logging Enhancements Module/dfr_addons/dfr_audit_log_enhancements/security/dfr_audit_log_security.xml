        This file is primarily for menu security configurations if new, specific groups
        for audit log viewing were to be defined.
        However, it's preferable to reuse existing roles from the 'dfr_rbac_config' module.
        The menu item in 'views/dfr_audit_log_menus.xml' directly references
        groups like 'dfr_rbac_config.group_dfr_national_administrator' and
        'dfr_rbac_config.group_dfr_super_administrator'.

        If more granular access control beyond model-level permissions (defined in ir.model.access.csv)
        or specific groups for audit log viewing are needed in the future, they could be defined here.
        For example, a record rule could filter logs based on certain criteria, or a new
        res.groups record could be created.

        Example of defining a new group (if it were needed):
        <record id="group_dfr_audit_log_viewer_explicit" model="res.groups">
            <field name="name">DFR Audit Log Viewer (Explicit Example)</field>
            <field name="category_id" ref="base.module_category_hidden"/>
            <field name="comment">This is an example group. For DFR, existing RBAC groups are preferred.</field>
            <field name="implied_ids" eval="[(4, ref('dfr_rbac_config.group_dfr_national_administrator'))]"/>
        </record>

        Currently, no new groups or record rules are defined here as per SDS, relying on
        the permissions set in ir.model.access.csv and group assignments in dfr_audit_log_menus.xml.
