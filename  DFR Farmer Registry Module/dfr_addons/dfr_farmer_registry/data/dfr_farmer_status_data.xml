            Farmer statuses are defined as a fields.Selection directly in the 'dfr.farmer' model (dfr_farmer.py).
            Therefore, this data file is not strictly essential for populating status options
            unless a separate 'dfr.farmer.status' model with more complex attributes (e.g., descriptions, color-coding)
            was to be implemented.

            As per SDS Section 6.2: "For this SDS, farmer statuses are defined as fields.Selection directly
            in dfr_farmer.py, so this specific data file is not essential unless more complex status attributes are needed."

            This file is included to match the specified module structure.
            If a dedicated model 'dfr.farmer.status' were used, it would be populated here.
            Example:
            <record id="farmer_status_pending" model="dfr.farmer.status">
                <field name="key">pending_verification</field>
                <field name="name">Pending Verification</field>
            </record>
        -->
    </data>
