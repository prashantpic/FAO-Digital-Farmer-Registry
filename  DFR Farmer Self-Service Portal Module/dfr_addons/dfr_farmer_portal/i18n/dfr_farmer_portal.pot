# Note: This .pot file is a basic placeholder.
# Odoo's i18n tools will automatically scan the Python and XML files
# for translatable strings (e.g., _("text") in Python, or text nodes in QWeb)
# and generate the actual content for this file.
# Ensure all user-facing strings in controllers, QWeb templates, and potentially
# model field labels (if this module had its own models with user-facing labels)
# are correctly marked for translation.
