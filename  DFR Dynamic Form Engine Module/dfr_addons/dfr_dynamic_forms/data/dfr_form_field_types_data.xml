        This file is intended for pre-populating or configuring available field types
        if they were managed as separate data records (e.g., a 'dfr.form.field.type' model).
        However, as per the current SDS, 'field_type' is a Selection field directly on 'dfr.form.field'.

        The sequence 'dfr.form.version.sequence' is defined in 'ir_sequence_data.xml'.

        If other data related to field types (not sequences) were needed, it would go here.
        For now, this file remains minimal or empty as field types are hardcoded in the selection.
        If, for example, certain field types had default icons or specific JS behaviors configured via data,
        those records would be defined here.
        -->

        <!-- Example: If there were a model dfr.form.field.type.config -->
        <!--
        <record id="field_type_config_text" model="dfr.form.field.type.config">
            <field name="type_key">text</field>
            <field name="default_icon">fa-font</field>
            <field name="is_default">True</field>
