# Repository Specification

# 1. Name
DFR Business Process Orchestrator


---

# 2. Description
This repository serves as a Service Orchestrator, specifically a Workflow Engine, within the DFR Odoo backend. It is responsible for defining, managing, and executing complex, multi-step business processes that span across various DFR functional modules. For instance, it orchestrates the end-to-end farmer lifecycle management from self-registration validation (involving DFR_MOD_FARMER_PORTAL and DFR_MOD_FARMER_REGISTRY) to approval workflows, status transitions (REQ-FHR-011), and automated triggering of notifications (via DFR_MOD_NOTIFICATIONS_ENGINE) based on farmer status changes or dynamic form submissions. It leverages Odoo's native workflow capabilities, such as Automated Actions, Server Actions, and potentially custom Python logic for more intricate orchestrations. This module ensures that business rules related to farmer/household status transitions, de-duplication resolution workflows (post-flagging by DFR_MOD_FARMER_REGISTRY), and notification triggers are consistently applied. It acts as a central point for configuring and monitoring these cross-cutting workflows, ensuring that dependencies between different services (e.g., updating a farmer status triggers a specific notification and makes them eligible for a program captured via a dynamic form) are managed robustly. It effectively decouples the high-level process flow from the specific service implementations in individual modules, promoting better maintainability and clarity of business logic.
