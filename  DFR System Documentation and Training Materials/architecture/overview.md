# DFR System Architecture Overview

## 1. Introduction
This document provides a foundational understanding of the Digital Farmer Registry (DFR) system architecture. It is intended for technical stakeholders, developers, and administrators who need to comprehend the system's structure, components, and guiding principles.
*Req IDs: E.1.4, A.3.3, A.3.4*

## 2. Architectural Style
The DFR system employs a **Modular Monolith** architecture, with **Odoo** (Version 18.0 Community Edition) as its core backend framework. This approach provides a robust, integrated platform while allowing for clear separation of concerns through Odoo's modular structure. Custom modules are developed to cater to specific DFR functionalities, extending Odoo's native capabilities.

## 3. Key Components
The DFR system is composed of several key components that interact to deliver its functionalities:

*   **Odoo Backend:** The central application server built on Odoo. It hosts:
    *   Core DFR business logic.
    *   Data storage and management (PostgreSQL).
    *   Administrative user interface for system configuration and management.
    *   API endpoints for mobile application and potential external integrations.
*   **Mobile Application:** A native Android application (or Flutter-based, TBD) designed for enumerators to perform field operations, including:
    *   Farmer registration and data updates.
    *   Offline data capture and storage.
    *   Synchronization with the Odoo backend.
    *   GPS data capture for plots.
*   **API Layer:** RESTful APIs exposed by the Odoo backend, facilitating communication with the mobile application and potentially other authorized systems. These APIs handle data exchange, authentication, and other critical functions.
*   **Farmer Portal (Future Phase):** A web-based portal intended for farmers to access their information, services, and potentially perform self-registration or updates. This component is planned for a later phase.

## 5. Technology Stack Summary

*   **Backend Framework:** Odoo 18.0 Community Edition (Python, XML, JavaScript/OWL)
*   **Database:** PostgreSQL
*   **Mobile Application:**
    *   Option 1: Native Android (Kotlin/Java)
    *   Option 2: Cross-platform (Flutter/Dart)
    *   `[Placeholder: Final decision on mobile technology]`
*   **API:** RESTful APIs (JSON) built using Odoo controllers.
*   **Frontend (Odoo Web):** Odoo Web Library (OWL) framework, JavaScript, HTML, CSS.
*   **Deployment:** Docker containers, managed via Kubernetes or similar orchestration (TBD).
*   **Version Control:** Git

## 6. Architectural Principles
The DFR system architecture is guided by the following principles:

*   **Scalability:** The system should be designed to handle a growing number of users, farmers, and data volume. This includes both vertical and horizontal scaling capabilities for the backend.
*   **Security:** Security is paramount. The architecture incorporates security best practices at all levels, including data encryption (at rest and in transit), secure authentication and authorization, input validation, and protection against common web vulnerabilities.
*   **Maintainability:** The modular nature of Odoo and clear separation of concerns aim to simplify maintenance, updates, and troubleshooting. Adherence to coding standards and comprehensive documentation further support maintainability.
*   **Usability:** Both administrator and enumerator interfaces should be intuitive and user-friendly, catering to users with varying levels of technical expertise.
*   **Interoperability:** The API layer is designed to facilitate integration with other relevant national systems where required, promoting data exchange and avoiding data silos.
*   **Offline First (for Mobile):** The mobile application is designed to function effectively in areas with limited or no internet connectivity, with robust data synchronization capabilities.
*   **Modularity:** The system is built as a collection of loosely coupled modules (Odoo addons) to allow for easier development, testing, and deployment of specific functionalities.
*   **Configurability:** The system should be configurable to adapt to country-specific needs, such as custom form fields, administrative hierarchies, and specific business rules, without requiring core code changes where possible.
