# ADR-001: Choice of Odoo Version for DFR Backend

*   **Status:** Accepted
*   **Date:** 2024-03-15
*   **Deciders:** DFR Project Technical Lead, FAO Technical Team, Key Stakeholders

## Context and Problem Statement

The Digital Farmer Registry (DFR) requires a robust, scalable, and customizable backend platform to manage farmer data, dynamic forms, user roles, and provide APIs for mobile applications and potential external integrations. The platform needs to support a modular architecture, offer a good degree of out-of-the-box functionality relevant to enterprise applications (e.g., user management, reporting framework), and have a strong community or commercial support ecosystem. An open-source solution is highly preferred to align with FAO's policies and ensure long-term sustainability and flexibility for national counterparts.

The key decision is which version of Odoo (formerly OpenERP) to select as the foundational backend framework.

## Decision Drivers

*   **Long-Term Support (LTS):** Preference for versions with longer official support lifecycles.
*   **Stability and Maturity:** Balance between new features and proven stability.
*   **Feature Set:** Availability of core features and improvements relevant to DFR needs (e.g., UI enhancements, API capabilities, performance improvements).
*   **Community and Ecosystem:** Availability of community modules, documentation, and skilled developers.
*   **Licensing:** Alignment with project's open-source goals (Odoo Community vs. Enterprise).
*   **Technology Stack Modernization:** Newer versions often incorporate more modern web technologies and development practices.

## Considered Options

1.  **Odoo 18.0 Community Edition (Latest at time of decision):**
    *   Pros: Latest features, most recent UI/UX improvements, longest potential support runway from community, built on Python 3.10+.
    *   Cons: Being the newest, might have undiscovered bugs compared to older, more battle-tested versions. Fewer third-party community modules might be immediately available or fully migrated.
2.  **Odoo 17.0 Community Edition:**
    *   Pros: More mature than 18.0 at the time of decision, good feature set, active community.
    *   Cons: Shorter support runway compared to 18.0.
3.  **Odoo 16.0 Community Edition (LTS):**
    *   Pros: Official LTS version (typically 3 years from release), very stable, wide range of community modules.
    *   Cons: Older technology stack, might miss out on recent performance or UI improvements found in 17.x or 18.x.
4.  **Other ERP/Platform (e.g., Custom Build, Django-based, etc.):**
    *   Pros: Potentially more tailored solution.
    *   Cons: Significantly higher development effort, reinventing many wheels (user management, ORM, module system, etc.), smaller ecosystem for specific DFR needs. Considered out of scope early due to the benefits of an established ERP like Odoo.

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen Option:** **Odoo 18.0 Community Edition.**

**Rationale:**

*   **Alignment with "Latest Stable" Philosophy:** While 16.0 is LTS, Odoo's release cycle means 18.0 (released typically in Oct/Nov) represents the most current stable technology base with the longest forward-looking lifespan from the community and for custom development. By the time DFR development is in full swing and deployment occurs, 18.0 will have received several months of community vetting and bug fixes.
*   **Modern Features and Performance:** Odoo 18.0 is expected to build upon the performance and UI/UX improvements of version 17.0, offering a better user experience and potentially more efficient backend operations.
*   **Python Version:** Odoo 18.0 typically utilizes newer Python versions (e.g., Python 3.10 or 3.11), which offer language improvements and better performance.
*   **Future-Proofing:** Starting with the latest version provides the longest window before a major migration effort would be needed.
*   **Community Focus:** The Odoo community actively supports the latest versions. While some community modules might take time to migrate, core DFR functionalities will be custom-developed, mitigating this risk. The core Odoo platform itself is robust.
*   **No Showstoppers for Community Edition:** For the DFR's core requirements (farmer registry, dynamic forms, mobile API), Odoo Community Edition provides sufficient capabilities. Enterprise features (e.g., advanced accounting, specific manufacturing workflows) are not central to DFR.

## Consequences

### Positive:

*   Access to the latest Odoo framework features, security updates, and performance enhancements.
*   Longer lifespan for the chosen version, delaying the need for a major version upgrade.
*   Development team works with the most current Odoo technology.
*   Strong foundation for a modern, responsive user interface.

### Negative/Risks:

*   **Early Adopter Risk:** As a newer version, there might be initial bugs or fewer readily available third-party modules compared to an older LTS version. This will be mitigated by thorough testing and focusing custom development on core needs.
*   **Learning Curve:** Developers might need to familiarize themselves with any new patterns or changes introduced in 18.0 compared to previous versions.
*   **Dependency on Community for LTS:** Odoo Community versions are primarily supported by the community. While generally robust, this differs from the formal LTS provided for Enterprise versions. (Note: Odoo SA does provide security updates for recent community versions).

## Alternatives Considered and Rejected

*   **Odoo 16.0 LTS Community:** Rejected because, while stable, it would mean starting on an older technological base, potentially missing out on significant improvements in 17.x and 18.x, and facing an earlier EOL for community support or requiring migration sooner.
*   **Odoo 17.0 Community:** Rejected because 18.0 offers a longer future support window and incorporates further enhancements. The stability difference between a .0 release and a .x release from a few months prior is often minimal for core platform features.

## Further Actions

*   Proceed with setting up development and testing environments using Odoo 18.0 Community Edition.
*   Monitor community forums and Odoo SA updates for any critical issues related to Odoo 18.0.
*   Prioritize development of core DFR modules, minimizing reliance on third-party modules in the initial phase.

_This ADR is subject to review if significant, unforeseen issues arise with Odoo 18.0 Community Edition during the initial development phases._
