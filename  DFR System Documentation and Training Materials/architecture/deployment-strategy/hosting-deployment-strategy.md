# DFR Hosting and Deployment Strategy

## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the strategy for hosting and deploying Digital Farmer Registry (DFR) instances. It covers supported environments, infrastructure considerations, containerization, environment tiers, backup and disaster recovery, and an overview of the CI/CD approach.
This strategy aims to provide flexibility for country-specific contexts while ensuring robustness, scalability, and maintainability.
*Req IDs: A.3.4, E.1.4*

## 2. Supported Hosting Environments
The DFR system is designed to be adaptable to various hosting environments:

*   **On-Premise (Government Data Centers):**
    *   Suitable for countries with established national data centers and policies requiring data to remain in-country.
    *   Requires a capable IT team within the hosting institution to manage infrastructure.
*   **Cloud (Public/Private/Hybrid):**
    *   **Public Cloud Providers:** (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP) Offer scalability, managed services, and potentially lower upfront infrastructure costs. Choice depends on country preferences, data sovereignty regulations, and cost.
    *   **Private Cloud:** If a government or institution operates a private cloud environment.
    *   **Hybrid Cloud:** A combination, potentially for DR or specific services.
*   **FAO-Managed Hosting (Initial/Temporary):**
    *   May be considered for pilot phases or for countries lacking immediate capacity, with a clear plan for transition to national ownership.

!!! warning "Data Sovereignty"
    All hosting solutions must comply with national data sovereignty laws and regulations of the implementing country.

## 3. Infrastructure Specifications (Baseline Recommendations)
These are baseline recommendations for a production environment. Actual requirements may vary based on the number of users, farmers, and transaction volume. Detailed sizing should be performed for each country deployment.

### 3.1. On-Premise / IaaS
*   **Application Server(s) (Odoo):**
    *   **CPU:** 4+ vCPUs (e.g., Intel Xeon E5 series or equivalent)
    *   **RAM:** 16GB+ RAM
    *   **Storage:** 100GB+ SSD (for OS and Odoo application files)
    *   **OS:** Linux (e.g., Ubuntu Server 2 LTS, RHEL/CentOS)
*   **Database Server (PostgreSQL):**
    *   **CPU:** 4+ vCPUs
    *   **RAM:** 16GB+ RAM (more RAM is generally better for databases)
    *   **Storage:** 200GB+ SSD (high IOPS recommended for database data, logs, backups)
    *   **OS:** Linux
*   **Load Balancer (if scaling horizontally):**
    *   Hardware or software load balancer (e.g., Nginx, HAProxy).
*   **Network:**
    *   Gigabit Ethernet.
    *   Firewall configured to allow necessary traffic (HTTP/S, SSH, DB ports internally).

### 3.2. Cloud Service Recommendations (Examples)
*   **AWS:**
    *   **Application Servers:** EC2 instances (e.g., m5.xlarge or equivalent)
    *   **Database:** RDS for PostgreSQL (e.g., db.m5.xlarge)
    *   **Load Balancer:** Application Load Balancer (ALB)
    *   **Storage (for backups, static assets):** S3
*   **Azure:**
    *   **Application Servers:** Virtual Machines (e.g., Standard_D4s_v3)
    *   **Database:** Azure Database for PostgreSQL (e.g., General Purpose, 4 vCores)
    *   **Load Balancer:** Azure Application Gateway
    *   **Storage:** Azure Blob Storage

## 4. Docker Containerization Strategy
*   **Odoo Application:** The DFR Odoo application (including custom modules) will be packaged as a Docker image. This ensures consistency across environments and simplifies deployment.
    *   A base Odoo image (e.g., official Odoo 18.0 image) will be used.
    *   Custom DFR modules and configurations will be added to this base image.
*   **PostgreSQL Database:** Can be run as a Docker container for development and testing. For production, managed database services (like RDS) or dedicated, well-managed PostgreSQL instances are generally preferred for performance, reliability, and manageability.
*   **Nginx (Reverse Proxy/Load Balancer):** Often used in front of Odoo, can also be run as a Docker container.
*   **Orchestration (Recommended for Production):**
    *   For managing multi-container deployments, **Kubernetes (K8s)** is the recommended orchestrator.
    *   Alternatives like Docker Swarm can be considered for simpler setups if K8s expertise is limited.
    *   `[Placeholder: Decision on specific orchestration tool and sample K8s deployment manifests/Helm charts to be provided in developer guides]`

## 5. Environment Tiers
A standard three-tier environment strategy is recommended:

1.  **Development (Dev):**
    *   Purpose: For developers to build and unit test features.
    *   Setup: Can be local Docker instances on developer machines or a shared dev server.
    *   Data: Sample data, frequently reset.
2.  **Staging (UAT/Pre-Production):**
    *   Purpose: For User Acceptance Testing (UAT), integration testing, performance testing, and training.
    *   Setup: Should closely mirror the production environment's architecture and configuration.
    *   Data: Anonymized production data or realistic test data. Refreshed periodically.
3.  **Production (Prod):**
    *   Purpose: The live environment used by end-users.
    *   Setup: Highly available, secure, monitored, and backed up.
    *   Data: Live operational data. Access is strictly controlled.

## 6. Backup Strategy
A robust backup strategy is critical.

*   **Database Backups (PostgreSQL):**
    *   **Frequency:**
        *   **Full Backups:** Daily (minimum).
        *   **Incremental/Differential Backups or WAL Archiving:** Continuous or very frequent (e.g., every 15-60 minutes) to minimize data loss (Point-In-Time Recovery - PITR).
    *   **Tools:** `pg_dump`, `pg_basebackup`, Barman, or cloud provider's managed backup services.
    *   **Retention:**
        *   Daily backups: Retain for at least 7-14 days.
        *   Weekly backups: Retain for at least 1-3 months.
        *   Monthly/Quarterly backups: Retain for 1+ year(s) based on country policy.
    *   **Offsite Storage:** Backup copies must be stored in a separate physical location (or different cloud availability zone/region) from the primary server.
    *   **Testing:** Regular testing of backup restoration procedures is mandatory.
*   **Application Code/Configuration:**
    *   Version controlled in Git. Docker images stored in a registry.
    *   Odoo filestore (attachments): Backed up regularly, consistent with database backups.
*   **Backup Automation:** All backup processes must be automated.
*   **Monitoring:** Backup success/failure should be monitored, with alerts for failures.

## 7. Disaster Recovery (DR) Approach
*   **Recovery Time Objective (RTO):** The maximum acceptable time for the system to be unavailable after a disaster.
    *   `[Placeholder: Define RTO target, e.g., < 4 hours for critical DFR functions]`
*   **Recovery Point Objective (RPO):** The maximum acceptable amount of data loss, measured in time.
    *   `[Placeholder: Define RPO target, e.g., < 1 hour]`
*   **DR Strategy Options (depending on RTO/RPO and budget):**
    *   **Backup and Restore:** Restore from offsite backups. Longest RTO.
    *   **Pilot Light:** A minimal version of the environment is always running in the DR site, ready to be scaled up.
    *   **Warm Standby:** A scaled-down version of the fully functional environment is running in the DR site. Data is regularly replicated.
    *   **Hot Standby (Multi-Site Active/Active or Active/Passive):** Fully functional duplicate environment with real-time data replication. Shortest RTO/RPO but most complex and costly.
*   **DR Plan:** A detailed DR plan must be documented, including:
    *   Activation criteria.
    *   Roles and responsibilities.
    *   Step-by-step recovery procedures.
    *   Communication plan.
*   **DR Testing:** The DR plan must be tested regularly (e.g., annually).

## 8. CI/CD Overview
A Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline is recommended to automate the build, test, and deployment process.

*   **Tools:**
    *   **Version Control:** Git (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).
    *   **CI/CD Server:** Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, GitHub Actions.
    *   `[Placeholder: Decision on specific CI/CD toolchain]`
*   **Pipeline Stages (Example):**
    1.  **Commit:** Developer pushes code to a feature branch.
    2.  **Build:**
        *   CI server pulls code.
        *   Run linters, static analysis.
        *   Build Docker image for Odoo application.
    3.  **Test:**
        *   Run automated unit tests.
        *   Run automated integration tests (potentially against a temporary test DB).
    4.  **Deploy to Staging:**
        *   If tests pass on develop/main branch, automatically deploy Docker image to Staging environment.
        *   Run UAT, performance tests (can be manual or automated).
    5.  **Deploy to Production:**
        *   Manual trigger after successful UAT and approval.
        *   Strategies: Blue/Green deployment, Canary release (if infrastructure supports).
*   **Artifact Management:** Docker images stored in a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub, AWS ECR, GitLab Container Registry).

More details on the CI/CD pipeline will be available in the [CI/CD Pipeline Developer Guide](../developer-guides/ci-cd-pipeline.md).

## 9. Monitoring and Logging
*   **Application Performance Monitoring (APM):** Tools like Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog, or Odoo's built-in monitoring.
*   **Log Management:** Centralized logging for Odoo application logs, web server logs, database logs (e.g., ELK stack, Splunk, cloud provider logging services).
*   **Alerting:** Setup alerts for critical errors, performance degradation, and security events.

This strategy provides a framework. Specific choices and configurations will be detailed in country-specific deployment plans and relevant developer guides.
