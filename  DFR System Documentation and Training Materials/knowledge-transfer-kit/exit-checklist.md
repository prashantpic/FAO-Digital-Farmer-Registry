# DFR Knowledge Transfer & Handover Exit Checklist

## 1. Introduction
This checklist is a critical component of the Digital Farmer Registry (DFR) Knowledge Transfer Kit. Its purpose is to ensure a comprehensive and systematic handover of all project assets, documentation, knowledge, and responsibilities from the development/implementation team to the national counterparts or the designated long-term maintenance team.

This checklist should be reviewed and signed off by representatives from both the transferring and receiving parties.
*Req IDs: D.1.6, E.1.4*

**Date of Handover:** `[Placeholder: YYYY-MM-DD]`
**Transferring Party/Team:** `[Placeholder: Name of Development/Implementation Team]`
**Receiving Party/Team:** `[Placeholder: Name of National Counterpart/Maintenance Team]`
