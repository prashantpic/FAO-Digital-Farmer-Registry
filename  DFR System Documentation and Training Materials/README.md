# Digital Farmer Registry (DFR) System Documentation Repository

Welcome to the DFR System Documentation and Training Materials repository. This repository serves as the central knowledge base for the Digital Farmer Registry (DFR) project.

## Overview

This repository contains the source files for the DFR Documentation Portal, a static website generated using MkDocs. The portal provides comprehensive information about the DFR system, including:

*   **System Architecture:** Detailed blueprints, architectural decisions, and data models.
*   **User Manuals:** Role-based guides for administrators, enumerators, support teams, and farmers.
*   **Developer Guides:** Technical documentation for developers working on or integrating with the DFR.
*   **Training Materials:** Resources for training sessions, including quick start guides, video scripts, and Train-the-Trainer program materials.
*   **Governance and Standards:** Frameworks for codebase governance and standards for documentation and coding.
*   **Licensing Information:** Details about the open-source licenses used in the DFR project.
*   **Knowledge Transfer Kit:** Documents to support the handover and long-term maintenance of the DFR system.

*   `licensing/`: Provides details on open-source licensing for the DFR system.
*   `user-manuals/`: Contains role-specific user guides (Administrator, Enumerator, Support Team).
*   `developer-guides/`: Includes technical guides for developers, such as codebase onboarding, API documentation, and CI/CD pipeline information.
*   `training-materials/`: Houses various training resources like quick start guides, video scripts, helpdesk SOPs, and ToT program materials.
*   `knowledge-transfer-kit/`: Comprises documents for the final handover, including checklists and report templates.
*   `assets/`: Stores shared assets like images, stylesheets, and downloadable files used throughout the documentation.

## Building the Documentation Locally

[Placeholder: Instructions for building the documentation locally using MkDocs. This typically involves:
1.  Cloning the repository.
2.  Ensuring Python and pip are installed.
3.  Installing MkDocs and required plugins (e.g., `pip install -r requirements.txt` if a `requirements.txt` file is provided).
4.  Running `mkdocs serve` from the repository root to view the live-reloading local site.
5.  Running `mkdocs build` to generate the static HTML files in the `site/` directory.]

## Contribution Guidelines
