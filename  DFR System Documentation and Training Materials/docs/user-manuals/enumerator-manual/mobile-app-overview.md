    !!! success "Successful Sync"
        After a successful sync, your pending data count should be zero, and the app should indicate that it is up-to-date.

    !!! important "Regular Synchronization"
        It is crucial to synchronize your data regularly (e.g., at the end of each workday, or whenever a stable connection is available) to:
        *   Ensure your collected data is safely backed up on the server.
        *   Receive the latest updates, form definitions, and farmer data.
        *   Prevent data loss in case of device issues.

## 7. Battery and Data Usage Considerations

*   **Battery:** Using GPS and having the screen on for extended periods can consume battery.
    *   Carry a power bank if you expect long days in the field.
    *   Close the app when not actively using it for long durations.
    *   [Placeholder: Country-specific advice on battery management.]
*   **Data Usage:** Data synchronization will use your internet connection.
    *   Prefer Wi-Fi for large syncs if available.
    *   Be mindful of your mobile data plan. The app is designed to be efficient, but large amounts of data (especially photos, if supported) can consume more data.
