Assigning Roles/Groups** |                |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 4.1     | 1:45-2:30      | **Visual:** Screen recording: On the new user form, scroll to the "Access Rights" or "Application Accesses" tab/section. Cursor points to different application groups (e.g., "DFR / Enumerator", "DFR / Supervisor", "Administration / Access Rights"). Check a relevant DFR role. | Proper access rights are crucial. Under the 'Access Rights' or application-specific section, you'll assign roles or groups. For DFR, you'll typically see roles like 'DFR Enumerator', 'DFR Supervisor', or 'DFR National Admin'. Select the appropriate group based on their responsibilities.                            |

Too much access can be a security risk. You can also remove groups if assigned incorrectly.                                                                                                                                                                              |

| 5.1     | 2:45-3:15      | **Visual:** Screen recording: User list view. Select a demo user. Show the "Action" menu. Cursor points to "Archive" (for deactivation) and "Unarchive" (if showing an archived user).                                                                                 | To deactivate a user, for example, if someone leaves the project, select the user from the list. Go to the 'Action' menu and choose 'Archive'. Archived users cannot log in. You can 'Unarchive' them if needed.                                                                                                      |
| 5.2     | 3:15-3:45      | **Visual:** Screen recording: On a user's form, click "Action" -> "Send password reset instructions" or "Change Password" (if admin sets it). Highlight the email notification if "Send password reset instructions" is chosen.                                                | If a user forgets their password, you can help them. From the user's form, under the 'Action' menu, you can 'Send password reset instructions' via email. Alternatively, depending on system configuration, you might have an option to 'Change Password' directly for them, which should be done securely.                  |
| 5.3     | 3:45-4:00      | **Visual:** Screen recording: On the user form, point to fields like "Latest Connection" or other relevant user activity indicators.                                                                                                                                    | You can also review user activity. The user form often shows information like their 'Latest Connection' date, helping you monitor account usage.                                                                                                                                                                         |

Apply the principle of least privilege â€“ only grant access necessary for their role. Regularly review user accounts and deactivate those no longer needed.                                                                      |

This adds an extra layer of security.

**Notes for Production:**

*   Ensure screen recordings are clear and cursor movements are easy to follow. Use zoom/highlighting features where appropriate.
*   Maintain a consistent pace in narration.
*   Replace all `[Placeholder: ...]` text with actual information or visuals.
*   Adapt Odoo menu names/labels if they differ slightly in the specific DFR Odoo version/customization.
*   Consider adding country-specific examples or branding if this video is localized.
