            Menu item access is primarily controlled by the 'groups' attribute directly
            on the <menuitem> definitions in 'views/dfr_main_menus.xml'.
            This file would typically be used if this module defined new security groups
            or needed to apply record rules to models defined *within this module*.
            Since this module is primarily a UI aggregator and uses groups from dfr_rbac_config,
            this file might be minimal or only contain comments explaining this.

            Example of restricting a menu defined in this module to a specific group,
            if not done directly in the menu XML (though direct is preferred for menus):

            <record id="menu_dfr_root" model="ir.ui.menu">
                <field name="groups_id" eval="[(6, 0, [ref('dfr_rbac_config.group_dfr_user')])]"/>
            </record>

            However, it's generally better practice to put the `groups` attribute directly on the
            <menuitem> tag in the menu XML file itself for clarity.
            This file would be more relevant if this master UI module introduced its own specific
            models that needed record rules.

        <!-- This file might be empty if all menu access is handled directly in dfr_main_menus.xml -->
        <!-- Ensuring the DFR Root Menu is visible to the base DFR user group -->
        <!-- This is usually done on the menuitem itself, but can be reinforced here -->
        <!--
        <record model="ir.ui.menu" id="menu_dfr_root">
            <field name="groups_id" eval="[(4, ref('dfr_rbac_config.group_dfr_user'))]"/>
        </record>
